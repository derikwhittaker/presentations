###Title
Going Realtime w/ Node.js

###Abstract
In the not too distant past JavaScript development was not only hard and time consuming but we could only execute our javascript in the browser on the client side.  However, in today's world JavaScript tooling is top notch, JavaScript development is very easy and most importantly we can run JavaScript anywhere.

In this session we will learn how to use NodeJs to build a server side JavaScript application.  We will learn how to harness the power of Node's Event-driven, non-IO blocking runtime to build a real time event messaging system.  By the end of this session you will understand how to download, install and configure Node along with how to utilize Node to build a server side messaging system written in JavaScript.

This will be a demo heavy session with very little slides so be prepared to get your code on.
