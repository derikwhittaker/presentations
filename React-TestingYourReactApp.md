==============

### Target Length
50-60 min

### Summary
Building awesome products can be pretty straight forward, but ensuring those products stay awesome over the long haul can be tricky.  Unless you teach your product how to dodge bullets by ensuring high test coverage.  This session will start from at ground level and assume no prior knowledge of testing w/ Jest. We will take you on a training mission to build products that withstand the test of time.

### Abstract
Building an awesome product in React is fairly easy, but how do you ensure your awesome product will withstand test of time?  How can you ensure that as your business needs change your product will not collapse under its own weight?  By teaching your code how to dodge bullets? 

This session will jumpstart your testing engine and teach you how to make your React application dodge bullets by using Jest to test your React application.  We will begin by adding a single test and build from there.  By the end of this session you will be armed with the knowledge on how to create tests given various scenerios, learn how use mocks and spys to avoid crossing broundries, learn how to use snapshot testing to ensure your UI stays solid, as well as how to automate the running of your tests.
