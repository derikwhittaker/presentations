0 to React in 1 Session: How to jumpstart you React Experiance
==============

### Target Length
50 min

### Summary
This session is for the React beginner. We will assume the attendees have zero experiance with React and want to get started.  We will start off with nothing and build our first application.  Each step along the way will be broken down so attendees know the 'why' not just the 'how'.

### Abstract
React? Perhaps you have heard about this awesome JavaScript framework that powers Facebook and many other web applications. Maybe you even have it on your To Do list to learn how to use it. But, for one reason or another, you just haven't had the opportunity yet. If this describes you, then you will not want to miss this presentation.
 
In this session, we will build our first React application from the ground up. While doing so, I will assume that you have no working knowledge of the framework. Along the way, I will show you 'how' to do things, and, more importantly, 'why' we do it that way. In the end, you will be armed with the necessary knowledge to start building your very own React application.

At the end of this session, you will be armed with the knowledge needed to start building your very own React application.
