0 to React in 1 Session: How to jumpstart you React experiance
==============

### Target Length
50 min

### Summary
This session is for the React beginner. We will assume the attendees have zero experiance with React and want to get started.  We will start off with nothing and build our first application.  Each step along the way will be broken down so attendees know the 'why' not just the 'how'.

### Abstract
React?  You have heard about this awesome JavaScript framework that powers Facebook and you have been meaning to dive into learning how to use React but for one reason or another you have not had a chance to.  If this describes you then you will not want to miss this session.

In this session we will build our first React application from the ground up.  While doing so I will assume that you have no working knowledge in the framework and will guide you step by step walk though creating a React application.  Along the way I will not only show you 'how' to do this, but more importantly 'WHY'.

At the end of this session you will be armed with the knowledge needed to start building your very own React application.
