###Title
GruntJs - Funny Name, Awesomely powerful tool

###Abstract
As developers we are tasked with building applications which simplify lives of our end users but how do we manage our code?  How does we transform our raw code to a deployable asset?  The answer to this seemingly simply question can be pretty complicated.  

The simple answer could be to bury your head in the sand and do nothing.  You could even do a whole bunch of manual stuff but both of those options suck.  A better solution is to use a task automation tool and Grunt may be the right tool for you.

If your project requires the ability to transform, validate, compile, along with much more you will need a higher level tool to perform these actions.  One such tool is GruntJs.  In this session we will learn how to use GruntJs to build, transform and deploy a web project.

###Learning Objectives
- Why task automation is needed
- How to use task automation to create reliable build processes
- How to transform code based on platform/environment
