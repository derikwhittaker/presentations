###Title
SignalR - Going realtime w/ .Net

I want and I want it now, using SignalR to resuce

###Abstract
We live in a society where people want information and they want it now.  This means users of our applications want data in real time, or as close as possible to real time.  If we are not able to meet users desire to always be connected to their information they will move on to another application which fills this need.

Historically, providing realtime information to users in your application has been challenging at best and darn near impossible in most cases.  But times and technology are changing.  Developers now have technology and libraries at their disposal which make the once challenging or impossible, simple and elegant. SignalR is one of these technologies.

In this session we will explore the problems SignalR solves and how to solve them with SignalR.  By the end our journey you will know how you can utilize SignalR to build a real time application to communicate between your server and client applications.

** NOTE **
This will be an interactive session where the participants will take part in the demo.
