###Title
TypeScript -- The Gateway Drug

###Abstract
If you have not been paying attention JavaScript has pretty much won the war of 'write once, run anywhere' as it can now run on both the client and server side.  And if you're like most people who are new to JavaScript, it can seem scary and intimidating to try to pick up.
    
This is where Typescript comes in. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.  Typescript tries to make sense of some of JavaScript's language 'issues' (aka wth does that syntax mean).  
	
In this session we will focus on how to go from 0 to 60 in JavaScript in no time flat all because of the awesomeness that is Typescript. By the end of this interactive session you should be hooked on JavaScript , I mean Typescript, and the fear and intimidation of learning JavaScript should be gone.
