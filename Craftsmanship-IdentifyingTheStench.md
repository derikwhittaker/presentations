Identifying the Stench: Learn to Identify and Resolve Code Smells
==============

### Target Length
30-50 min

### Summary
This session will be a live, interactive session where the attendees and I will peer through code and identify, discuss and resolve common code smells.

### Abstract
Developers want to write clean, readable, and maintainable code. But, this is not always executed. Sometimes, we write code that… well, to be nice, has the stench of a wet dog. You had every intention of writing an elegant masterpiece that would surely become the reference model of great code for years to come. But, for one reason or another, it did not go as planned. The code works and satisfies the business need, but it is difficult to follow, and is hard for others to maintain.
 
"Code smells" are warning signs that source code may be violating good design principles. In this session, we will learn to identify many common code smells and how to fix them. Each smell that is removed from source code will improve its maintainability. So, let’s whip out the Lysol and deodorize that stinky code! The next developer will thank you.
