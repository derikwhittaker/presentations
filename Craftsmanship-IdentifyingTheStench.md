Identifying the Stench: Learning to identify and resolve code smells 
==============

### Target Length
30-50 min

### Summary
This session will be a live, interactive session where the attendees and I will peer through code and identify, discuss and resolve common code smells.

### Abstract
Most developers want to write clean, readable and maintainable code, but this is not always executed.  Sometimes we write code that is well.... to be nice has the stench of a wet dog. You wanted to write great code but for one reason or another it did not go as planned. Sure the code may work or solve the desired need, but it may not be maintainable or is difficult to follow. When this type of code is produced it is called a code smell.

In this session we will whip out the Lysol and learn how to deodorize your code.  We will look at many different examples of code smell and how we can turn the stench into sweet smelling aroma
